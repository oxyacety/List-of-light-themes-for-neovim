# List-of-light-themes-for-neovim

  The motivation for this list is that most searches regarding neovim themes mainly cover dark themes. Since I enjoy and prefer using light themes I started curating this list. The goal is to give a good overview of the avaiable light themes for neovim. Solarized themes will not be considered.

  The vscode.nvim theme by Mofiqul is a port of the well known VS code color scheme. It comes with a light and dark variant. The following screenshot shows vs code light with treesitter highlighting enabled.
