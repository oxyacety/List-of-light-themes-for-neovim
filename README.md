# List-of-light-themes-for-neovim

  The motivation for this list is that most searches regarding neovim themes mainly cover dark themes. Since I enjoy and prefer using light themes I started curating this list. The goal is to give a good overview of the avaiable light themes for neovim. Solarized themes will not be considered.
